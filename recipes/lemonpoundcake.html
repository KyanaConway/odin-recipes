        <h3 class="heading">Lemon pound cake recipe from scratch</h3>
        <p>This recipe is more tedious than our <a href="../recipes/fruitdip.html">Fruit Dip Recipe</a> but even more rewarding!</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Half a Dozen Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Box of Swans Down Cake Flour</li>
            <li>2 Blocks of Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Lemon Extract</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Dominos Powered Sugar</li>
            <li>Dominos Cane sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading">Cake Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Let all ingredients sit out unrefridgerated to make the mixing process quicker. This will aid in having a smooth batter!</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325 degrees and grab a big bowl</li>
            <li>Swift 3 cups of flour into a big bowl</li>
            <li>Add in 1 block of cream cheese</li>
            <li>Sift in 3 cups of cane sugar</li>
            <li>Mix flour and cream cheese together mixer until smooth</li>
            <li>Add in eggs. <strong>Mix these one by one and not all together.</strong> This step is crucial for a fully cooked caked! </li>
            <li>Add two table spoons of both vanilla and lemon extract in. <strong>Don't add too much vanilla</strong> because this extract is very overwhelming in flavor.</li>
            <li>After your extract, slowly pour your batter evenly into desired cake shaper and place in oven. I prefer the bundt shape!</li>
            <li>Levae in oven for exactly an hour and a half and remove!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Glaze steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Grab smaller bowl and scoop half a block of cream cheese in</li>
            <li>Add Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Add powdered sugar for consistency</li>
            <li>The amount for these ingredients are based on prefrence. Experient until you acheive desired flavor and texture!</li>
        </ol>
